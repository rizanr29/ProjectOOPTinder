CaCo, which stands for Campus Companion, is a mobile app created to help students discover study partners and plan their schedules. Students can use CaCo to establish their own profiles and look for other students with comparable academic interests and schedules. In order to keep on top of their academics, students can use the app to create reminders for their classes, assignments, and tests. CaCo is the ideal friend for students on campus, whether you're seeking for a study partner or simply want to keep your academic life organised.
